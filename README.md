# Alternate_Mouse
Alternate Mouse is a mouse simulation system which performs all the functions of a mouse corresponding to your hand movements and gestures. Simply speaking, a camera (i.e., webcam) captures your video and depending on your hand gestures, you can move the cursor and perform left click, right click, drag, select and scroll up and down. We can implement this using image processing module OpenCV and Python specific library PyAutoGUI. PyAutoGUI is a Python module for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard. The predefined gestures make use of only three fingers marked by different colors.

Keywords: OpenCV, PyAutoGUI.

Requirements: Python interpreter, NumPy, Three different color fingertips
